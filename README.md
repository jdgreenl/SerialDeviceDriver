Serial Device Driver and Protocol Communication

# What I Learned

To develop a UART device driver library (uart.h/c) to implement
an interrupt-driven full-duplex serial link to a remote computer.
Then make use of this library by writing an independent application (protocol.h/c)
using this new serial driver library to communicate with a Python program running on 
a connected remote PC
